Description: pyTimechart is aimed at helping kernel developer to browse into large scale traces.
        
        Based on very powerful and efficient plotting library *Chaco*, pytimechart UI feels very smooth.
        
        Based on the python language, its plugin based architecture allow developer to very quickly implement
        parsing and representation of new trace-event function-trace or trace_printk
        
        Kernel traces are parsed as trace-events, and organised into processes, each process
        is displayed in its own line. The x-axis representing the time, process is represented
        as intervals when it is scheduled in the system.
        
        pyTimechart processes are not only *process* in the common unix sense, it can be any group
        of activities in the system. Thus pytimechart display activities of:
        
        * cpuidle states
        * cpufreq states
        * runtime_pm
        * irqs
        * tasklets
        * works
        * timers
        * kernel threads
        * user process
        * whatever there is a plugin for
        
        pyTimechart also represent graphically the wakeup events between two process.
